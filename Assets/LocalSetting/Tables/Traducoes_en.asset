      who could speak with animals. Jurupari, the god of darkness, envious, killed

      the \"Boy\u2019s Body,\" a boy with inverted feet and fiery hair, is protecting
      the forest. But what value could this forest have to be protected? The gold
      is in the mountains; here, there is only game and mushrooms. Yesterday, I mistakenly
      ate the red ones and had strange nightmares, like being a giant plumber fighting
      turtles for gold coins. Perhaps this, too, is the work of some mysterious entity."

    m_Localized: Under orders from their king, a group of settlers embarked on caravels
      in search of new lands for colonization. During their journey, they faced fierce
      storms, but the brave and fearless settlers were undeterred. They spotted a
      peculiar "island" and immediately set their course toward it.

    m_Localized: As they approached their goal, they encountered mysterious and dangerous
      sea creatures guarding the island's coast. After defeating the marine beasts,
      they moved closer to the island, which revealed a vast forest upon closer inspection.
      The settlers landed and began their preparations.

    m_Localized: Their captain immediately ordered them to set up camp and build
      a fire, then to scout the forest and return before nightfall. The island was
      eerily quiet, yet immense. The settlers spent the entire afternoon preparing
      their shelters. During the night, the captain noticed that some settlers were
      missing. Determined to find them, he ventured into the forest alone.

      he was lost\u2014his companion had the compass. With each step, he felt a chilling
      presence behind him. After wandering for some time, he spotted something burning
      in the distance. He tried to hide, but he hadn't realized he'd already been
      seen. When he became aware of this, he started running for his life, desperately
      searching for his companions. While hiding, he began thinking about the materials
      he\u2019d need to escape the island, especially after discovering that their
      caravels had been damaged."
